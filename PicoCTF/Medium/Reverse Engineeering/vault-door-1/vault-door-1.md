## Solution

Download the java file using the hyperlink given in the description. Analyze the java code, it can be found that the password is hardcoded within the java code but unlike previous challenge, the password is split into characters.

Basically the idea is to descramble the order of the characters given in the code, i.e ```password.charAt(n)='c'``` where n is the position and c is the corresponding character.

Thus adding the password between ```{ }``` of the ```picoCTF{ }``` is the flag to the challenge
