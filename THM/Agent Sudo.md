The Challenge consist of different section with different set of objectives and questions.

Start the machine and copy the IP address. Check the IP address is reachable using ```ping```, ```-c 4``` denotes number of packets to be sent.  
```
ping -c 4 <IP address>
```
If ```4 received, 0% packet loss``` is printed as output, IP is reachable.

For enumeration, start by using nmap to scan the IP and find open ports and services.
```
sudo nmap -sV -sC -O -v <IP Address>
